/**
 * This project simplifies the frustrating parts of chemistry, <br>
 * so you no longer have to stare at a periodic table and perform redundant calculations <br>
 * as long as you have basic knowledge of Java.
 * <br>
 * <h2>WARNING:</h2>
 * Each class (Element, Compound, and Ion) has a corresponding CSV table that <br>
 * <b>MUST</b> be located in a folder named rsc contained within the project's root directory. <br>
 * The corresponding class will not work if its CSV file cannot be found.
 * <br>
 * <h4>Examples:</h4>
 * <br>
 * Get Element: <br>
 * {@code Element element = Element.getElement(ElemList.O);}
 * <br><br>
 * Get Compound: <br>
 * {@code Compound compound = Compound.getCompound("HCl");}
